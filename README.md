This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications where JSON data is not received in POST requests due to a missing middleware. The bug.js file contains the erroneous code, while bugSolution.js provides the corrected version with the necessary middleware added.  The issue arises when the application attempts to access req.body without first parsing the incoming request body as JSON.  The solution involves using express.json() middleware to parse the JSON data.
